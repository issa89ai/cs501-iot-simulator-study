\## 📌 Project Description

This project presents a \*\*comparative study of an open-source IoT simulator\*\* different from Cooja.  

The study investigates and compares the simulator with \*\*Cooja Simulator\*\* based on:



\- Supported operating systems  

\- Supported programming language(s)  

\- Available motes and their roles  

\- Advantages and shortcomings compared to Cooja  

\- Demo examples that demonstrate code execution on motes (with results/screenshots in the report)  

\- Conclusions and references
